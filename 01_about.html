## About

Hey!!

My name is Aron Bordin; I’m Brazilian researcher and freelancer. I’m studying Computer Science at São Paulo State University, and always coding something fun on my free-time :) 

Currently, I work as a Data Scientist using Deep Learning for Image Processing and Natural Language Processing (NLP); using these methods to analyze public and government data.

You can find me at GitHub [@aron-bordin](http://github.com/aron-bordin)
